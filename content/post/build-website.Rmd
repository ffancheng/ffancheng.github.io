When you want to include a pdf file in your Rmarkdown post, here are the tips for you.

- If the file is from your online Github repo, you should first get the link for the file.

First click the [PDF file in your Github repo](https://github.com/ffancheng/CufeBuaaSeminars/blob/master/2018_S1/20180420/20180420_FanCheng_MovingKnots.pdf). Then right click in the `download` button and copy the link by `copy link address`.

[PDF from existing Github repo](https://github.com/ffancheng/CufeBuaaSeminars/raw/master/2018_S1/20180420/20180420_FanCheng_MovingKnots.pdf)


- If it is a local file, just put it in the `content/post/`, `static/` or `static/courses/` folder.

[Files from /content/post/ folder](20190228_Report.pdf)

[Files from static/ folder](../../static/20190228_Report.pdf)

[Files from static/courses/ folder](../../static/courses/)
