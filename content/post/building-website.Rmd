This is a post about how to build your websites.

# Github Setting

## Register for a Github account
If you haven't got an Github account, please register [here](https://github.com).

## Creat a new repository
In you repository page, press the "New Repository" button on the top-right to create a new repository to run your website.

Input the repo name as "USERNAME.github.io", where the "USERNAME" is your github account name. Make sure you repo is set to be public and "Initialize with a README".

## Create a new branch
Since the Github page is deployed through the `master` branch, we need a new branch to run the source code for building the website. In the `branch` button, input `sources` and press the "Create new `sources` branch". Then you can switch between your two branches `master` and `sources`.

## Change the default branch to `sources`
Next to the `1 commit` in your repository, there is a `2 branches` button. Press it and you can see `master` branch is set to be your default branch. Then `change the default branch` to be your newly built `sources`. There will be windows for you to confirm your change. Please make sure `I understand`. Now if you go back to your `2 branches` page, you will see your default branch is set as `sources`. 

By doing this, you will later be able to create a new website in your default `sources` branch and deploy it to the `master` branch such that your Github page can be built through the `master` branch. 
## Clone your repository
Now you need a local copy of your Github repo.

First, install Git in your computer. (TODO)

Second, generate and add SSH key to your Git agent. Open the terminal and generate the SSH key using
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUREMAIL@gmail.com"
```
During the process, you will be asked to choose a file name for your key, and `ENTER` three times would be fine. Then the key is saved as `/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa`.

Next, add the key you just generated to your Git agent using
```
eval "$(ssh-agent-s)"
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Finally, copy the key to your Github settings. You can open the public key `/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` with an editor and copy it, or use the command line
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
After that, go to your Github settings - SSH and GPG keys - New SSH key, and paste the key with a name you like.

If you have already finished with the SSH key, you can clone the repo in your terminal using `git clone "https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git"`. Now your have a local copy of the Github repo like this.

If the whole process goes well, then you are all set with Github now.
