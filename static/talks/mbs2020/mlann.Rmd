# Irish Smart Meter Data

- Problem of interest: electricity usage patterns of households

- Half-hourly data for 535 days in 3639 households

- Empirical discrete distributions: $48 \times 7=336$ distributions per household

```{r smartmeter, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap="Two smart-meter demand examples from the Irish smart meter data set.", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("smartmeter.png")
load("smartmeter_2id.rda")
library(shiny)
div(
  plotly::ggplotly(p, width=600, height=400),
  align = "center")
```

# How to estimate emprical distributions?

- *Objective*: to approximate the distribution of electricity demand $d_{i,t}$ for household $i$ over time period $t$

- *Steps*: 

      - Group all data and construct an evenly spaced grid $\kappa_0,\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_G$ of size $G=200$ with $\kappa_0=\underset{i,t}{\min} d_{i,t}$ and $\kappa_G=\underset{i,t}{\max} d_{i,t}$ as endpoints.
      
      - Compute $\pi_{i,g}=(1/T)\sum_t I(\kappa_{g-1}<d_{i,t}<\kappa_g)$ where $T$ is the total number of time periods.
      
      - Vector $\pi_i$ represents a probability mass function over discrete bins.

???

- Why quantiles over kernel density estimate?

    - Missing values; highly skewed data; non-negative support

# Why manifold learning?

## To work with 336 distributions per household

---

# Manifold learning

- *Manifold*: where the data set lies on a low-dimensional Euclidean space embedded in a high-dimensional feature space

- Manifold learning: non-linear dimension reduction tool
*by preserving the local geometry structure*. 

- Manifold learning methods: Isomap, LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, etc.

# Manifold Learning for Single Household

- Similar times of day are grouped closely together

- Cyclical patterns observed in the representation

- Three clusters roughly corresponding to three phases of a typical day
    
    working during the day (08:00 - 17:00);
    recreation during the evening (17:00 - 00:00);
    sleeping (00:00 - 08:00)

```{r nnembedding, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", fig.cap="", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("tod_1id1row_1id336tow.png")
```

???
The cyclical pattern observed in the representation is indicative of the fact that low values for half hour of the day (00:00, 00:30, 01:00) are temporally proximate to high values for half hour of the day (22:30, 23:00, 23:30) and are therefore similar.

## Computational efficiency matters

# Manifold Learning with Approximate Nearest Neighbors

.pull-left[
- We propose to improve the efficiency by searching for approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) instead of exact ones. 

- **Goal**: largely decrease the computation time without losing much accuracy (high embedding quality)

- ANN methods: k-d trees, Annoy, HNSW

```{r ann, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap="Illustration of approximate nearest neighbors compared to exact ones. ", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
