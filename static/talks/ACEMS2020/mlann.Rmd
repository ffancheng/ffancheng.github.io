# Irish Smart Meter Data

- Problem of interest: electricity usage patterns of different households

- Half-hourly data for 535 days in 3639 households

- Empirical probability distributions: $48*7=336$ distributions for each household


```{r smartmeter, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "60%", fig.cap="Two smart-meter demand examples from the Irish smart meter data set.", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("smartmeter.png")
load("smartmeter_2id.rda")

# Manifold Learning for High-dimensional Data

- Manifold learning: non-linear dimension reduction tool
*by preserving the local geometry structure*. 

<!-- to extract the representation of data lying along a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional space -->

```{r nnembedding, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap="", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("tod_1id1row_1id336tow.png")
```

- But what about **8 million** households in VIC? Computation efficiency matters

### Manifold Learning with Approximate Nearest Neighbors

- We propose to improve the efficiency by searching for approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) instead of exact ones. 

- **Goal**: largely decrease the computation time without losing much accuracy (high embedding quality)

- ANN methods: k-d trees, Annoy, HNSW

```{r ann, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", fig.cap="Illustration of approximate nearest neighbors compared to exact ones. ", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ann.png")
```

### Manifold Learning with Approximate Nearest Neighbors

- We propose to improve the efficiency by searching for approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) instead of exact ones. 

- **Goal**: largely decrease the computation time without losing much accuracy (high embedding quality)

- ANN methods: k-d trees, Annoy, HNSW

```{r compare, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap="Comaprison of three ANN methods for four manifold learning methods. ", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nohnsw-1.png")
```

## Application 1: time-of-day electricity usage patterns

```{r annembedding, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "90%", fig.cap="2-d embeddings from four manifold learning methods, with the color representing half-hourly time of day. Top panel: Exact NN. Bottom panel: ANN. ", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("tod_compare_1id336tow.png")
```

---

## Application 2: anomaly detection for unusual households

```{r hdr, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "75%", fig.cap="High density region plot from the Hessian LLE embeddings using exact NN (left panel) and ANN (right panel). The most typical points are shown in red, while the most anomalous are shown in black.", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("hdr10_comparehlle_1id336tow.png")
```
